For a while I've been wanting to create a place where I can post tidbits of information I've learned through my days, both at work and outside. I set up a couple static site generators trying to find one I like working with. I tested with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and finally landed on [Gatsby](https://www.staticgen.com/gatsby) after coming across it on [risingstars2016](https://risingstars2016.js.org/).

In this post I'm going demonstrate:
1. Setting up Gatsby
2. Adding a theme
3. Creating a new post
4. Push blog to GitHub
5. Host blog on GitHub Pages
6. Redirect GitHub Pages to a custom domain.


## Setting up Gatsby

Getting started with Gatsby was incredibly simple, the documentation on their [README](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/README.md) is in part to thank for that.

- Start off by globally installing Gastby: `npm install -g gatsby`

- Create a new blog: `gatsby new my-blog`

- Change directory to the generated folder: `cd my-blog`

- Run Gatsby in develop mode: `gatsby develop`

At this point you should see:
```
Server started successfully!
Listening at:
   http://0.0.0.0:8000
```
You should see the gatsby blog on your `localhost:8000` with the default theme.

## Adding a theme

Gatsby's repo has starter themes in the `Gatsby Starters` section of the README.

After going through a couple of the themes in that section I landed on  [Lumen](https://github.com/wpioneer/gatsby-starter-lumen).

To use this theme we'll have to create another blog and apply the theme from the start. After we do this we will have no need for the blog we created up there.

- Change directory to parent folder: `cd ..`

- Delete my-blog: `rm -r my-blog`

- Create a new blog with Lumen theme: `gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/wpioneer/gatsby-starter-lumen`

- Change directory to generated folder `cd blog`

- Run Gatsby in develop mode: `gatsby develop`

The blog should be on `localhost:8000` again, with the Lumen theme. Go ahead and open this folder in your editor of choice.

Now lets personalize this site to have more content about you. Right off the bat you'll notice the site title is generic, that picture's not yours, there is dummy text in the description, about me, and contact me, and there may be some extra icons in the 'Social' area than you need.

Most of these can be tackled in the `config.toml` file in your root project directory. Update the `site-title`, `siteDescr`, and `siteAuthor`. As for the social site urls add links to the ones that matter to you, and for the rest you can choose to delete them or leave the `#`. Google analytics ID you can choose to add if you have one and we'll talk about the `linkPrefix` later.

Having added links to social media, it's time we updated the page to reflect that change. Open `components/SiteLinks/index.jsx` and update the list there to only show the links you require.

Next we'll the contents of the blog. Starting with the 'About me' and 'Contact Me' pages, the code to which can be found in the `index.jsx` file under `pages/pages/about` and `pages/pages/contact` respectively. As for the blogs, they are located under `pages/articles`. If you decide to get rid of the blogs, in the next section I have a script that creates a new post for you.

## Creating a new post

It's quite arduous creating a blog post, especially with the date format in the file and the folder name. I searched around Gatsby to see if they had an auto-create but couldn't find anything. I did however run into this [script](https://github.com/pamo/pamo.github.io/blob/development/new_post.js), pretty solid script. I made a couple additions to include a couple more details, here is my script:

```Javascript
const prompt = require('prompt')
const mkdirp = require('mkdirp')
const moment = require('moment')
const _ = require('underscore.string')
const yaml = require('js-yaml')
const fs = require('fs')

prompt.start()

/*eslint-disable */
prompt.get(['title', 'path', 'category', 'description'], (err, result) => {
  'use strict'
  const dir = `./pages/articles/${ moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD') }-${ _.slugify(result.path) }`
  mkdirp.sync(dir)

  let postFileStr = '---\n'

  const frontmatter = {
    title: result.title,
    date: moment().toJSON(),
    layout: 'post',
    draft: true,
    path: `/${result.path}/`,
    category: result.category,
    description: result.description,
  }

  postFileStr += yaml.safeDump(frontmatter)
  postFileStr += '---\n'

  fs.writeFileSync(`${ dir }/index.md`, postFileStr, {
    encoding: 'utf-8',
  })

  return console.log(dir);
})
```

This script is also in [my repo](https://github.com/RonakR/ronakraithatha.github.io/blob/master/new_post.js), incase you need to check if it's up to date.

Run the script in your terminal with: `node <file_name>.js`

Follow the prompts and viola, a new folder and post with the frontmatter will be added to your `pages/articles`.

## Push blog to GitHub

Github is where the blog will version controlled and hosted from. In this section we'll cover how to get the blog under version control, we'll look into hosting in the coming sections.

To get started you will need a GitHub account, you can create that by visiting [GitHub](https://www.github.com). Next you'll create a new repository on there by clicking the `+` button next to your profile picture on the top right. Enter the name for your repository here - I would suggest `blog` to make things easier down the road - add a small description for now (you can change that later), public repository is fine for now. Click on `Create repository` leaving the initialize checkbox unchecked.

**NOTE:** If you're new to GitHub or need a quick refresher, I suggest skimming through [this quick guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) first.

You will be directed to a page with some instructions, follow the instructions under `â€¦or create a new repository on the command line`, except echo `"# test-site" >> README.md` and instead of `git add README.md` you will, just this one time, use `git add .` to add all files.

Here's a quick recap of what each step does:

- `git init` Initializes a repository in the current folder

- `git add .` Adds all changed files to the staging area

- `git commit -m "first commit"` Creates a commit for all files in the staging area. Commits are the most integral part of Git, and always require a commit message.

- `git remote add origin <URL>` Notifies your git instance that `URL` is the place in the location in the internet where it can send/receives changes; it's aliased to `origin` by convention. Also of note, `local` means your machine and `remote` means a location somewhere else on the internet, which in our case is GitHub's servers.

- `git push -u origin master` Pushes any commits on your local machine to the remote location specified at `origin`. `master` is the conventional name for the fist branch in your repo.

That's it, now refresh that GitHub page and you should see your files from your blog folder appear on GitHub. Now you can use the above steps: `add`, `commit`, `push` to keep your GitHub up to date with the changes you make locally.

## Host blog on GitHub Pages

GitHub provides a service where it will host static files and display them as webpages through their domain.

The gist of GitHub Pages is you can add a static `html` file with other supporting files to either `master` or `gh-pages` branch and it will be hosted on GitHub under `<username>.github.io/<repo_name>`. You can read more about it [here](https://pages.github.com/). Generally you want to host from `gh-pages` since master will be used for development code, not static files.

Now is also the time to change the `linkPrefix` in the `config.toml` to `/<repo_name>`.

There is a script in the `package.json` file in the root directory of the blog named `deploy`. It looks like this:
```JSON
"scripts": {
  ...,
  "deploy": "gatsby build --prefix-links && gh-pages -d public"
 },
```
That link used the [gh-pages npm library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) to publish files to a `gh-pages` branch on the repo.

Dissecting that script will help better understand it. The first part `gatsby build --prefix-links` builds the blog (taking into accoutnt he `linkPrefix`) and that build is stored in `/public`. `gh-pages -d public` then takes the contents of `/public` and creates a `gh-pages` with them. To run the script from the `package.json` type `npm run <script_name>` in the CLI. In this case it will be: `npm run deploy`

Voila, if everything went without a hitch, visit `<username>.github.io/<repo_name>` to see your blog. At this point you have a blog on the internet. Go forth and write about your day-to-day escapades. Remember to keep your repository on GitHub up to date.
