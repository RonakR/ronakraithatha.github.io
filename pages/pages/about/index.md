Ronak Raithatha, born and raised in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania and moved to the US in 2010. Originally had the intention of becoming a pharmacist, instead took a turn to computing and have looked back.

I primarily work in the back-end during my day to day, but love dabbling in the front-end during my free time. I enjoy writing JavaScript, and am learning Scala on the job.

Love playing D&D, Overwatch, League of Legends; though I suck at two out of three of those, mechanical keyboards and drinking!
